HTML Processing Architecture

Markup => Bytes => Chars => Token => Node => DOM [Layout] => Rendering => Painting

Browser Engine:  It is responsible for  Parsing [Translating]
                             Markup => Bytes
	            Bytes  => Chars
                             Chars  => Token
                             Token  => Node

Rendering Engine: It is responsible for generating output
	              - Prepare DOM
	              - Generate Layout
	              - Undergo Rendering
	              - Paint

What is HTML?
- HTML is a markup language.
- It comprises elements arranged in a hierarchy called "DOM".
  [Document Object Model]
- Elements are known as "Nodes"
- Elements are created by using Token known as "Tag"
- Elements in HTML are categorized into following groups

	1. Normal Elements
	2. Void Elements
	3. RC Data Elements
	4. Raw Text Elements
	5. Foreign Elements


Normal Element:
- Normal element can present content directly on callback without using
  additional attributes.
- It starts presentation and will not stop.
- You have to stop explicitly. By using End Token.

   Start Token [Start Tag]  <b>
   End Token [End Tag]    </b>

Void Elements:
- The term void means nothing to return.
- They return any presentation by using additional attributes.
- After returning what you asked to again it will stop.
- Void elements are self ending. No end token required.

Ex:    <img> 
         <img src="pic.jpg"> 
         <img src="pic.jpg" />


3. RC Data Elements
- Rich Content Elements
- These are used only for content.
- You can't use any other presentation within the context.

Ex: 
<textarea> </textarea>

4. Raw Text Elements
- Elements are presented not by using Token.
- They are presented by using normal text [Raw Text]

Ex:
       &copy;	copyright 
       &#8377;	Indian Rupee

5. Foreign Elements
- These are the element used in HTML but not native to HTML.
- They need additional library to import inorder to use.

Ex: 
	MathML
	SVG
	Canvas etc..
